# Developer docs

This section is for contributors and advanced users.

## API reference

The `Developer API` subsection is generated by TypeDoc from `src/plugin.ts`.

To regenerate it locally:

```bash
npm run docs:api
```

From the repository root, you can also run:

```bash
npm run docs:build
```

That command loads rule docs directly from `docs/rules`, generates TypeDoc output, and builds the Docusaurus site.
